know the top highest voted questions on Stack Overflow with a specific
keyword. This project helps you to that by showing the top highest
voted questions of a keyword with the highest voted answer on the site.

## How to run
- Run the command with two arguments `N` and `LABEL`:
  `python3 top_voted_stackoverflow.py N LABEL` where
   * `N` is number of the top highest questions
   * `LABEL` is the tag
- A sample command: `python3 top_voted_stackoverflow.py 10 sql`
